# InternshipProject

During summer internship in Meta Software Solutions (https://mss.ba/) we were creating an app used for Asset management.
This app is used to record and track an asset through its life cycle. It provides information like where certain assets are located,
who is using them and details about the asset. The asset management software is used for management of both software and hardware assets.
It also provides  additional functions like: storing vendor info, storing products info, access to assets location, table view of a certain report with a possibility of review in pdf format, keeping track of employees and their assignements.

For furter review of app please access it here https://internship2021.mss.ba/login
